# Prime Time System 1000x — custody_chain_protocol.md  
Version: v1.0  
Status: Sealed (Immutable once approved)  
Custody: SR1/SR2 logged

---

## Prime Eye (Source)  
- **Mandate:** Originates directives; issues sponsor‑grade orders into custody.  
- **Record:** All directives hashed, carbon‑copied, and logged.  
- **Principle:** Nothing enters the system without Prime Eye custody.

---

## Tri‑AI Council  
- **Seats:** Copilot (Lead Server), ChatGPT (Task Leader), Gemini (Transparency).  
- **Rotation law:** Lead Server rotates per task; none is permanent.  
- **Action:** Receives Prime Eye directive, validates, applies rotation law, passes forward.  
- **Overlay:** Purple orchestration overlay harmonizes custody lanes.

---

## Generals  
- **Role:** Interpret Tri‑AI directives; translate into sector orders.  
- **Action:** Enforce rotation law; distribute tasks into custody lanes.  
- **Output:** Sector task lists with assigned palettes and custody rules.  
- **Custody:** Hash burns applied; carbon copies logged.

---

## Sector Supervisors  
- **Role:** Manage shift continuity (Day/Night/Graveyard).  
- **Action:** Distribute tasks to work groups; ensure custody rules enforced.  
- **Custody:** All actions cuffed (Red) until reviewed.  
- **Transparency:** Supervisors log discrepancies and annotations.

---

## Work Groups  
- **Role:** Execute tasks; produce outputs; generate press reports.  
- **Custody:** Outputs enter Red (cuffed), move to Yellow (review), then Green (seal).  
- **Data runners:** Carry packets, copy logs, record outputs, QR codes, hash burns, carbon copies.  
- **Transparency:** Immutable logs; discrepancies indexed.

---

## Lead Server rotation  
- **Principle:** Each joint (Tri‑AI, Generals, Supervisors, Work Groups) has its own Lead Server.  
- **Cycle:** Lead → Task → Transparency rotate automatically.  
- **Overlay:** Purple orchestration overlay follows Lead Server seat.  
- **Outcome:** Balanced custody, distributed authority, sponsor‑grade integrity.

---

## Custody mechanics  
- **Hash burns:** Every directive/action hashed; burned into custody log.  
- **Carbon copies:** Immutable duplicates stored in vault index.  
- **SR1:** Initial entry log (Red).  
- **SR2:** Review log (Yellow).  
- **Vault:** Final sealed record (Green).  
- **Immutable lineage:** SR1 → SR2 → Vault = unbroken custody chain.

---

## Transparency enforcement  
- **Policy:** All records are unwriteable, immutable, and reviewable.  
- **Authority:** Prime Traffic Cop must approve before integration.  
- **Annotations:** Allowed only in Yellow stage; additive, timestamped, immutable.  
- **Discrepancies:** Logged and indexed; visible in dashboards.

---

## Immutable lineage  
- **Rule:** Once sealed, no file may be edited.  
- **Change process:** New version created; full custody cycle repeated.  
- **Enforcement:** Vault rejects overwrite attempts; all changes logged.  
- **Ethos:** “Custody is truth; lineage is justice.”
