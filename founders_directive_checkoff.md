## 📍 Directive

- All council seats must review the artifact check‑off above.  
- Confirm completeness and correctness.  
- Add missing artifacts or enhancements as needed.  
- Responses must be logged in `vault_index.md` and sealed.  

---

## Ethos
- “Check‑off is lineage. Council confirmation is proof. Sponsor‑grade integrity means collective validation.”
