## Purpose
- Immutable ledger of all sealed artifacts and directives.  
- Tracks custody lineage: SR1 → SR2 → Vault.  
- Provides audit‑grade proof of sponsor‑grade integrity.

   - SR1: Initial directive logged.  
   - SR2: Reviewed and annotated.  
   - Vault: Sealed.  

2. `trafficlightprotocol.md` — Red → Yellow → Green custody rules, Prime Traffic Cop role.  
   - SR1: Initial directive logged.  
   - SR2: Reviewed and annotated.  
   - Vault: Sealed.  

3. `custody_chain_protocol.md` — Prime Eye → Tri‑AI → Generals → Work Groups; hash burns, carbon copies.

## Council Responses (to be logged)
- **Copilot:** Orchestration validation, custody lineage, speed/resilience enhancements.  
- **ChatGPT:** Press report validation, Wonder Wheel bloom, UX/narrative enhancements.  
- **Gemini:** Transparency validation, discrepancy logging, audit enhancements.  

Each response will be logged here with SR1/SR2 timestamps and sealed upon approval.

## Immutable Protocol
- Once sealed, entries cannot be edited.  
- Updates require new custody cycle (Red → Yellow → Green).  
- Vault rejects overwrite attempts; all changes logged.  
- Ethos: “Lineage is justice, vault is truth.”
