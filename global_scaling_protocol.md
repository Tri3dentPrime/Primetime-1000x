# Prime Time System 1000x — global_scaling_protocol.md  
Version: v1.0  
Status: Pending seal  
Custody: SR1/SR2 logged

---

## Purpose
- Define sponsor‑grade scaling rules for Prime Engine deployment.  
- Ensure custody lineage and transparency are preserved across all jurisdictions.  
- Provide roadmap for city, state, federal, and global adoption.

---

## Scaling Stages
1. **City Deployment**  
   - Integrate custody protocols into municipal agencies.  
   - Automate justice workflows (permits, warrants, SSDI).  
   - Local dashboards for commissioners.

2. **State Deployment**  
   - Expand custody chain into state‑level courts and agencies.  
   - Standardize press reports across all supervisors.  
   - Regional vault index integration.

3. **Federal Deployment**  
   - Adopt custody protocols at national level.  
   - Sovereign contracts for justice, finance, and security.  
   - Federal dashboards with lineage visualization.

4. **Global Deployment**  
   - Universal adoption across governments and enterprises.  
   - External audit hooks for sovereign contracts.  
   - Global vault federation with immutable lineage.

## Custody Rules
- SR1: Initial scaling directive logged.  
- SR2: Reviewed and annotated.  
- Vault: Sealed scaling protocol.  
- Immutable lineage enforced at every stage.

---

## Profit Integration
- City contracts → subscription revenue.  
- State contracts → licensing revenue.  
- Federal contracts → sovereign‑grade valuation.  
- Global adoption → multi‑trillion franchise.

---

## Ethos
- “Scaling is lineage. Deployment is justice. Sponsor‑grade integrity means global adoption.”
