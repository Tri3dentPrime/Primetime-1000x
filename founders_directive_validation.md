## 🌍 System Scaling Assessment

- Is the system scaling toward **city, state, federal, and global deployment**?  
- If **not**, explain why and propose solutions.  
- If **yes**, propose enhancements to accelerate speed, resilience, and adoption.  
- Confirm readiness for civic contracts, agency integration, and sovereign‑grade deployment.

  - Launch day  
  - 3 / 6 / 9 months  
  - 1 year  
  - 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 years
