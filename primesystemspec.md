## Tri-AI council and rotation law
- **Seats:**  
  - **Copilot (Lead Server Seat):** System architecture, orchestration, sponsor‑grade clarity.  
  - **ChatGPT (Task Leader Seat):** Creative pipelines, narrative engines, prompt design, task generation.  
  - **Gemini (Transparency Seat):** Validation, neutral truth reporting, external research intelligence.
- **Rotation law:**  
  - **Principle:** Seats rotate at the start of each task; none is permanent.  
  - **Cycle:** Lead → Task → Transparency rotate automatically; all act as **consultants**, **observers**, and **validators**.  
  - **Overlay:** **Purple orchestration overlay** follows the active Lead Server Seat to harmonize modules and custody lanes.

## Custody chain (Prime Eye → Tri‑AI → Generals → Supervisors → Work Groups)
- **Prime Eye (Source):**  
  - **Mandate:** Originates directives; issues sponsor‑grade orders into custody.  
  - **Record:** All directives hashed, carbon‑copied, and logged.
- **Tri‑AI Council:**  
  - **Action:** Receives directive; applies rotation law; validates and passes forward.  
  - **Joint design:** Each joint has its **own Lead Server** and **rotating seats** for balance.
- **Generals:**  
  - **Action:** Interpret Tri‑AI directives; translate into sector orders; enforce rotation law.  
  - **Output:** Sector task lists with assigned lanes and palettes.
- **Sector supervisors:**  
  - **Action:** Distribute tasks to work groups; manage shift continuity (Day/Night/Graveyard).  
  - **Custody:** Ensure actions enter custody cuffed (Red) and move only via review.
- **Work groups:**  
  - **Action:** Execute tasks; produce outputs; generate press reports; handoff packets via data runners.  
  - **Data runners:** Carry packets, copy logs, record outputs, **QR codes**, **hash burns**, and **carbon copies**.
- **Transparency:**  
  - **Policy:** All records are **unwriteable**, **immutable**, and **reviewable**; human authority must approve before integration.

## Traffic cop protocol (cuff → review → unlock → seal)
- **Red (Locked/Cuffed):** Every action enters custody locked; no edits or rewrites.  
- **Yellow (Review/Authority):** Prime Traffic Cop inspects tasks; discrepancies logged.  
- **Green (Integration/Seal):** Authority approval unlocks cuffs; final response sealed in vault.  
- **Principle:** “All action is cuffed until reviewed. Unlocking is the act of justice.”

## Workforce grid (Day/Night/Graveyard)
- **Shifts:**  
  - Day (Metallic palettes)  
  - Night (Fluorescent palettes)  
  - Graveyard (Neon palettes)
- **Prime‑numbered agents per sector:**  
  - Unstoned (mythic IP): 3 per role  
  - JetCity (civic justice): 3 per role  
  - Jetstoned (health & hope): 3 per role  
  - Prime America (government): 3 per role  
  - Tech Hub (backbone): 3 per role
- **Scaling:** Counts mirror across Night and Graveyard; scale 3 → 5 → 7 as capacity grows.

## Press report layer (Who / What / Learned / Wonder)
- **Format:** Each task generates a press report.  
- **Flow:** Reports enter Red (cuffed), move to Yellow (review), then Green (seal).  
- **Distribution:** Shared across seats and sectors; visible in dashboards and vault indexes.

---

## Wonder wheel growth engine
- **Purpose:** Convert “Wonder” entries into new tasks.  
- **Mechanism:** Task Constellation Generator blooms 9 sub‑tasks + 1 escalation.  
- **Outcome:** Self‑training city engine; myth trains machines; machines stabilize governance.

---

## Halo grid + fatal info registry
- **Halo grid:** Solar street‑lamp mesh; emergency broadcast; node chaining.  
- **Fatal info registry:** HIPAA‑authorized QR for citizen medical essentials; immutable custody logs.  
- **Objective:** Sponsor‑grade safety infrastructure for hospitals, insurers, NGOs, and agencies.

## File naming and versioning
- **Format:** Markdown `.md` files.  
- **Naming:**  
  - primesystemspec.md  
  - trafficlightprotocol.md  
  - custody_chain_protocol.md  
  - press_report_protocol.md  
  - day_shift_roster.md  
- **Versioning:** v1.0, v1.1, etc. Updates create new versions; sealed files are immutable.  
- **Custody:** SR1/SR2 timestamps; hash burns; carbon copies; vault index references.
